# Non-Hermitian Persistent Current Transport

This repository contains the code developed to accompany the manuscript titled *Non-Hermitian Persistent Current Transport* [[1](#refer-anchor-1)]. The code is written in Jupyter notebooks and demonstrates the application of DMRG for calculating persistent currents in open quantum systems.

## Contents

- `SNS.ipynb`: A phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting (SNS) junction.
- `Ring.ipynb`: A normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux.

## Usage

To run these notebooks, ensure you have [DMRGpy](https://github.com/joselado/dmrgpy) installed. Each notebook is self-contained and provides step-by-step computation leading to the ground state energy and persistent current as a function of the phase. The analysis focuses on the influence of many-body interactions on the persistent currents and scrutinizes the signatures of exceptional points within these systems.

## Future Work

More codes related to symbolic calculations and other aspects of the research will be shared in the future.
